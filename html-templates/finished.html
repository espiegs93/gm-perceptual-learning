<p><b>Great, you finished the experiment!</b>

<p>This is what we are looking for: In the main part of this experiment you saw quite a number of algebraic expressions and had to pick a the correct equivalent expression from a list of
options. Research shows that perception plays an important role even in seemingly abstract tasks like solving equations. One purpose of this research is to explore how our perception can be trained so we do math more fluently and with less effort.

<p>
We greatly appreciate your help in this research, it would not be possible without your effort. If you have questions or concerns about participating in this experiment, please feel free to ask us.

Best,<br/>
Erik Weitnauer (eweitnau@indiana.edu) and Adam Datema.
